Decentralised real time voice and video network overcoming the problem of centralized networks and shortcomings of federated networks. This repo provides description and specification.

## Aims
* deal with centralisation and walled garden problem of networks (having effective monopolies due to “network effect”)
* deal with problems inherent in federated networks (ie. why WatsApp won over XMPP) [1]
* ability to call from any to any device (e.g. regular voice call from mobile phone network to a “logged in” web browser)
* focus on reachability, and quality of service (ie. a call should “just” work), over features
* ability to reward centralised network owners for access to their networks
* provide monetization ability in the decentralised network
